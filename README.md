# (WIP) High-Level-Things-In-C

What if you want to use C for almost everything? :)

## What includes?

- Memory and Exceptions manager. Garbage collection.
- Dynamic data structures:
  - List (array and double-linked).
  - Tuple.
  - Set.
- String as abstract type.
- More I/O features:
  - Setting up things before main and tearing down after main.
  - Custom colors and styles (ANSI characters).
  - Custom "game engine". In other words it is a function that is executed in a loop until a specific return.
